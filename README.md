# Machine Learning Project: Predicting Data Scientist Salaries

## Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict the salary of a data scientist based on various features. Whether you're exploring the world of data science salaries or looking to enhance your predictive modeling skills, this repository contains everything you need.

## Contents

All project files are conveniently organized within this repository:

- **Notebooks:** Explore and run the Jupyter notebooks to understand the project's development and analysis.
- **Python Scripts:** Find reusable Python scripts for key functionalities and data processing.
- **Dockerfiles:** Docker configurations for easy containerization and deployment.

## How to Use

- Download all notebooks and files
- Run the notebooks first
- Then run the train.py and predict.py scripts independently
- Create the Docker environment from the Dockerfile if you want to run Docker locally
- If you don't want to host via Docker locally, then you can follow the instructions from the link below to host on PythonAnywhere for free

## Hosting

This project is hosted on [PythonAnywhere]([https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)] for free hosting. The decision to choose PythonAnywhere was driven by its simplicity and convenience. You can find more information on hosting and deployment in the [How-To Guide](https://github.com/nindate/ml-zoomcamp-exercises/blob/main/how-to-use-pythonanywhere.md).
